## Summary 

##### This assignment analyzed data sets from a company interested in their employee data. Included in the data were employee numbers, departments numbers, department names, titles, salaries, and other demographic information for employees.

## Process
##### Six different sets of data were analyzed in SQL by first creating a table schema and then calling queries from those tables. An entity relationship diagram was also created to more easily demonstrate the relationships between the tables, as well as determine the primary and foreign keys. Inner joins were used to call from several tables at once.
